# indeed_scrapper
 This is an scrapper for Indeed.co.uk, the job ads website. This project has three parts, an advance webscrapper, a little exploratory analysis of those ads and a visualization tool using streamlite.

 Although sleepers where added in order to avoid IP ban by the website, some times the connection was blocked. I recomend use an VPN anc change server, or a similar solution, if it's going to be tried more than once in a short time period.

 The city name to coordinates translation is really slow too, making that the map take ages in appear (depending of the number of ads).
